Their product is fire from every aspect. Quality-wise their products are A1. The brand comes from the sporting capital of the world, Jalandhar India. They specialize in martial arts and Physical Fitness Equipment.It is different from the heavy bag which is fairly stationary with a wide punching area, and therefore easier to hit. Double-end bag will raise your accuracy, as well as your hand-eye coordination, especially if you are able to connect on it multiple times in succession. It also helps with your rhythm.The double end bag, also known as the floor-to-ceiling bag, is a small, circular bag connected on both ends of the floor and ceiling by an elastic cord. They vary in size and shape, with rebound elasticity able to be adjusted. It offers a myriad of ways to perform different punching skill workouts.Unique to the sport of boxing, the double-end bag offers a chance to improve rhythm, timing, and accuracy more so than technique. It gives fighters the opportunity to experiment by throwing any kind of punch.Furthermore, the double end bag allows a fighter to improve accuracy. Technique and conditioning no doubt develop power, but timing and accuracy allow fighters to effectively use that power. Conversely, throwing power punches is easy, but connecting power punches on a mobile target is difficult.Sports Center recommends the double-ended Speedball for all levels of boxers ideally for training.  Especially for those who want to improve their game.",,"and shape, with rebound elasticity able to be adjusted, 30 lbs, small","High elastic hanging rope with strong extension, high elasticity. | Leather speed bag with double stitched and reinforced with triangle seams. | High-performance Shaft | Tension: 26 – 30 lbs | Suitable for MMA, fighting, boxing or daily training of reaction, accuracy, agility, endurance, etc. | Sturdy carabiners that withstand the tension",,Punching Bag USI UNIVERSAL Crusher (https://sportscenter.com.np/product/punching-bag-usi-crusher-3ft-20kgs/) | Boxing Gloves USI UNIVERSAL Immortal Safe Spar (https://sportscenter.com.np/product/boxing-gloves-usi-immortal-safe-spar/) | Boxing Head Guard USI UNIVERSAL Lite Contest (https://sportscenter.com.np/product/boxing-head-guard-usi-lite-contest/) | Punching Bag USI UNIVERSAL Fury (https://sportscenter.com.np/product/punching-bag-usi-fury/),,1 set Double-ended speedball and all the accessories shown in the pictures.,0,,,,,,"{""Weight"": ""1 kg"", ""Dimensions"": ""35 \u00d7 20 \u00d7 20 cm""}","https://sportscenter.com.np/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/double-ended-speed-ball-4-1-600x600.jpg, https://sportscenter.com.np/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/double-ended-speed-ball-3-1-600x600.jpg, https://sportscenter.com.np/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/double-ended-speed-ball-2-600x600.jpg, https://sportscenter.com.np/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/double-ended-speed-ball-1-1-600x600.jpg, https://sportscenter.com.np/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/crusher-300x300.jpg, https://sportscenter.com.np/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/immortal-safe-spar-2-300x300.jpg, https://sportscenter.com.np/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/head-guard-lite-300x300.jpg, https://sportscenter.com.np/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Punching-bag-USI-fury-300x300.jpg",2 in stock,2,True

Arm Blaster USI Universal With Adjustable Straps,https://sportscenter.com.np/product/arm-blaster-usi-universal-with-adjustable-straps/,2564.0,,,220267,USI Universal,Arm Blaster,"Exercise & Fitness, Fitness Accessories, Arm Blaster","An arm blaster is a lightweight piece of exercise equipment that’s usually worn while performing bicep curls. It’s worn in front of the body with an adjustable strap that rests on the back of the neck/shoulder area. An arm blaster forces the elbows in front of the lifter’s torso while they curl, as well as help keep the elbows stationary throughout the movement.Arm blasters were a popular exercise among the bodybuilding community back in the 1970s, but have dropped in popularity since. Because of this decrease in popularity, they’re seen as old school. But the principles of the arm blaster are still very popular today.Modern bodybuilders still use the “elbows in front” technique while they curl in the form of preacher curls and spider curls. Preacher curls involve performing curls while your elbows rest on what is called a “preacher bench”, while spider curls use an incline bench that the person rests their chest on while their arms hang in front and curl the weight.Despite the arm blaster being seen as “old school”, it’s actually a better alternative in many ways to the preacher and spider curl exercises.The first major advantage is that the arm blaster is much cheaper than a preacher bench or an incline bench. Not only is it cheaper, but it takes up much less space. An arm blaster is so light and slim, it can be easily stored away when not in use. If you’re looking to get a workout at home, an arm blaster is definitely the most afforable and practical way to go.Another advantage the arm blaster has over preacher curl or spider curl equipment is in its versatility. With an arm blaster, you can curl using an e-z curl bar (chamber bar), a straight bar, or dumbbells. The same can be done with preacher curls, but it is very awkward to perform barbell spider curls without the help of a partner. And when used correctly, the arm blaster is much more comfortable and less awkward than preacher curls or spider curlsThe Blaster keeps your arms in a fixed position against your trunk, with the claim being that this promotes proper form while also isolating the biceps. The idea, of course, is to “maximize the strength-building benefits of bicep curls”, and to give you that massive pump.An arm blaster is so light and slim, it can be easily stored away when not in use.

You step on it and try to balance your body to a point and try different workouts. This activates muscles, joints and ligaments.  It ends us working the muscle groups that are usually not worked during you’re conventional workouts.Balance boardcan be extremely beneficial to improving your everyday health and well-being. Did you know maintaining and challenging your balance is something that requires your entire body’s effort (including your mind) and therefore works many muscles and joints that don’t normally get as much attention. Wobble Board really does lend itself to help us do all this!Here are Top Five Benefits of using Wobble Boards…1. Improve Flexibility and Joint Strength:Not only does using a Wobble Board work lesser-used muscles, but it also greatly improves flexibility and joint strength: ankles, knees, hips, shoulders etc. This is because the Wobble Board simulates various types of instability that you don’t typically encounter on a day to day basis.2. Challenge Existing Pilates Exercises:The great thing about a Wobble Board is that it’s extremely versatile. There’s an unlimited number of Pilates moves that can be incorporated. Standing movements, sitting movements, movements on the hands, knees etc are all possible. Keeping things fresh and challenging for you each time!3. Engages Your Whole Body:Maintaining your balance and body control requires the whole body working in unison, including the mind.

Usually, the bands get damaged when exposed but here the buffer cloth takes all the beating thus the bands are safe and have a prolonged life.BENEFITS OF USING RESISTANCE BANDSSure, the gym is full of dumbbells and machines and weights of all kinds. But resistance bands offer many benefits that standard weights can’t:1. SAME MUSCLE ACTIVITY, LESS CHANCE OF INJURYTraining with elastics bands provides similar and sometimes even greater muscle activity as weight training. One major difference is that involves a lower amount of force on the joints, which means that more stimulus can be provided to the muscles with less chance of injury. This is also good news for anyone with existing injuries or joint pain, because resistance bands may allow you to continue working out and performing exercises that you can’t with dumbbells.2. GREATER MUSCLE STIMULUSOne major difference between free weights and resistance bands is the variable resistance applied through the full range of motion of an exercise. With free weights, there are actually parts of the movement when the muscles aren’t performing much work due to lack of gravity, such as at the top of a bicep curl. What this means, is that when using resistance bands, “The muscle is receiving greater resistance at its strongest point in the range of motion and therefore is receiving more adequate resistance to better stimulate strength adaptations.3. STABILIZATION/CORE ACTIVATIONThe constant tension from bands adds an element of required stabilization from your body to maintain form during many exercises. This also means that you will often need to activate your core for balance. The need to control them from snapping back into place means greater stimulation and strength through the muscle’s full range of motion, and the pull of the bands reduces your ability to cheat by using momentum.4. IMPROVED STRENGTH & ATHLETIC PERFORMANCEPower resistance bandsare extremely effective for athletic training due to the increased load, variable resistance, and instability. Experienced powerlifters and strength and conditioning professionals have claimed elastic band resistance combined with traditional training produces strength gains for several years. One test using elastic tension for back squats and bench press demonstrated that the bench press increase was doubled, and the back squat one-rep max improvement was nearly three times higher after using bands.Research also shows that using bands with weights improves neuromuscular performance and strength more than weight training alone. These bands can also be used for speed and agility drills for various athletic purposes.5. MORE EXERCISE OPTIONSWith dumbbells or barbells, you are limited to certain body positions in a vertical plane of motion to use the force of gravity. When using resistance bands, you can perform exercises in both the vertical and horizontal plane. For instance, you can do a chest press or back row in a standing position rather than having to use a bench. You can also train perform sideways movements, ideal for athletic activities like swinging a baseball bat or golf club, as well as and daily tasks like opening a door or moving a box.6. INEXPENSIVEDue to the fact that you can perform a variety of exercises with one band as mentioned in the examples above, it means you don’t need so many weights and machines. If you workout at home, a set of resistance bands can save you from buying so many expensive weights that also take up space.7. IDEAL FOR REHABILITATIONResistance bands and tubes have been proven to improve strength, size, and function of muscles in the elderly as well as those undergoing rehabilitation. Bands can provide very light or heavy resistance which can be used in targeted ways for specific muscles that also protects joints.8. STRETCHING & MOBILITYAny type of tube or flat band is great for both post-workout stretches, as well as pre-workout mobility work. Typically, you are limited during stretches by your level of flexibility and range of motion, and many effective stretches even require another person to provide pressure to the muscle. Instead, you can use bands to assist with stretching to extend your reach and provide pressure, such as with lying down hamstring stretches. Power bands are also excellent for mobility work when wrapped around sturdy object, such as improving ankle and hip mobility for squats.9. PERFECT FOR TRAVELIt can be hard to fit in workouts or even find a gym when you travel. Bands are a perfect option to pack in your bag that allow you to workout in a hotel room or outdoors without heavy equipment. They won’t weigh down your luggage, but will still give you an effective, full-body workout. For this same reason, they’re ideal for bodybuilders and fitness competitors, as well as models who need to pump up their muscles prior to a show or photoshoot.WHO SHOULD USE RESISTANCE BANDS?After reading the benefits of bands, it’s probably becoming clearer that anyone can use resistance bands to reach their fitness goals. Here are some specific groups that should use them and why:ANYONE TRYING TO GAIN MUSCLEIf you’re looking to gain muscle size and strength, you can use bands in place of dumbbells and machines to provide a new and challenging stimulus to your muscles for growth. You can also add them to barbell exercises to increase intensity and neuromuscular performance.ANYONE WANTING TO LOSE WEIGHTLosing weight is easiest when you combine a healthy diet, cardio, and strength training. Add bands to your workout routine, such as in a full-body circuit. This might look like doing a resistance band chest press, followed by squats with a band, followed by a back row with a band. This will burn calories and build muscle at the same time, which will help you to lose weight over the long-term.OLDER ADULTSFor adults around or over the age of 60, standard weights at the gym can be challenging and harsh on your body. Resistance bands help to maintain strength and muscle mass without overdoing it. Research indicates that training programs using elastic tubes are a practical, effective means of increasing strength in adults over the age of 65. Johns Hopkins Medicine recommends resistance bands as one of the safest methods to increase bone strength and help prevent osteoporosis.ATHLETESBands help prepare athletes for movements in every plane, both to improve strength and power, as well as to prevent injuries. 2004 National Boxing Champion, Daniel Sanchez, says, “As an athlete, I learned that there is nothing better out there to make you faster and stronger then resistant bands. You can take them with you everywhere get a good work out no matter where you are – very important for my training, especially with my shadow boxing, punching speed and even toning with no weight involved. If I had to pick dumbbells or bands, I would choose bands every time.”PREGNANT WOMENExercise is important during pregnancy for improving energy, sleep, mood and preparing for childbirth. However, this is not the time to dive into an intense weight-training program. Resistance bands and high repetitions (15-20) are great for light muscle-toning.

They help you develop bulletproof wrists and forearms as big as a mountain. They also help you in developing maximum grip strength for your hands.Hand grips are compact and portable lever-type devices that you squeeze in order to build up arm strength and muscle. Athletes mainly use them to increase their ability to excel at their chosen sport. Most sports involve the concept of moving weights or transferring the power of your body through the hands. Hand grips allow you to build up your lower arms, and this works to make you a better athlete, whether your sport is football, martial arts, weightlifting, baseball or even golf. Many of these sports depend on high lower arm strength, and working out with hand grips helps you develop this strength. Here are four benefits of using hand grips:1. More Forearm MuscularityIf you have ever wanted forearms that look impressive and bigger than most other men, you should work out with hand grips. The principle works in this fashion. Muscles that are situated in your forearms are the ones controlling your fingers. Your forearm flexors control the closing of your hand, while your forearm extensors control the opening. These muscles will be the primary beneficiaries of using hand grips.2. Hand EnduranceYour hand endurance is automatically increased when you work out with hand grips because you are increasing the quantity of force that your hands can apply. Another way that your hand endurance gets a big boost is in the length of time that you can apply force. As you work with handgrips, you can train yourself to apply pressure for longer periods of time. A practical area for which this provides instant benefits is, for instance, when you are carrying things like suitcases or heavy bags. After building up your hand endurance for a while, you will notice how you will not as easily succumb to fatigue from carrying them around.3. Increased Hand StrengthThe third benefit of hand grips is increased hand strength, where you train to increase the power of both your fingers and your wrists. Increased hand strength will help you out in areas like the gym, where you can then hold on to weights for longer periods of time. In other areas such as tennis, you will find that you will be able to significantly swing the racquet with more power. Activities like gymnastics and climbing are areas where having increased hand strength will be particularly important, too, as you must support your body weight with only your grip.4. Improved DexterityHand grips will work to build up your fingers independently, thus improving dexterity. Musicians sometimes work their fingers by using spring-loaded hand grips in order to make sure they can deftly build up enough strength in each finger to confidently apply just the correct quantity of pressure on their instruments. Typists can also benefit from improved dexterity.",,,Comes in a Pair | Aggressive grips for maximum hold | ergonomically shaped for best comfort and grip | High tensile steel used so that it doesn’t lose resistance over time,,Weight Lifting Straps USI UNIVERSAL Cotton (https://sportscenter.com.np/product/weight-lifting-straps-usi-cotton/) | Gym/ Sports Chalk USI UNIVERSAL Magnesium Carbonate (https://sportscenter.com.np/product/gym-sports-chalk-usi-magnesium-carbonate/) | Massage Dual Ball USI UNIVERSAL MDB (https://sportscenter.com.np/product/massage-dual-ball-usi-mdb/) | Weight Lifting Straps USI UNIVERSAL Leather (https://sportscenter.com.np/product/weight-lifting-straps-usi-leather/),,1 pair Hand Grip (2 pieces),0,,,,,,"{""Weight"": ""0.3 kg"", ""Dimensions"": ""15 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 10 cm""}","https://sportscenter.com.np/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/hand-grip-chinese-pair-1-600x600.jpg, https://sportscenter.com.np/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/lifting-straps-usi-3-1-300x300.jpg, https://sportscenter.com.np/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Gym_Chalk_Block_-_Magnesium_Carbonate_2000x-1-300x300.jpg, https://sportscenter.com.np/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/massage-ball-dual-2-300x300.jpg, https://sportscenter.com.np/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/wirst-strap-usi-1-300x300.jpg",12 in stock,12,True

They help you develop bulletproof wrists and forearms as big as a mountain. They also help you in developing maximum grip strength for your hands.Hand grips are compact and portable lever-type devices that you squeeze in order to build up arm strength and muscle. Athletes mainly use them to increase their ability to excel at their chosen sport. Most sports involve the concept of moving weights or transferring the power of your body through the hands. Hand grips allow you to build up your lower arms, and this works to make you a better athlete, whether your sport is football, martial arts, weightlifting, baseball or even golf. Many of these sports depend on high lower arm strength, and working out with hand grips helps you develop this strength. Here are four benefits of using hand grips:1. More Forearm MuscularityIf you have ever wanted forearms that look impressive and bigger than most other men, you should work out with hand grips. The principle works in this fashion. Muscles that are situated in your forearms are the ones controlling your fingers. Your forearm flexors control the closing of your hand, while your forearm extensors control the opening. These muscles will be the primary beneficiaries of using hand grips.2. Hand EnduranceYour hand endurance is automatically increased when you work out with hand grips because you are increasing the quantity of force that your hands can apply. Another way that your hand endurance gets a big boost is in the length of time that you can apply force. As you work with handgrips, you can train yourself to apply pressure for longer periods of time. A practical area for which this provides instant benefits is, for instance, when you are carrying things like suitcases or heavy bags. After building up your hand endurance for a while, you will notice how you will not as easily succumb to fatigue from carrying them around.3. Increased Hand StrengthThe third benefit of hand grips is increased hand strength, where you train to increase the power of both your fingers and your wrists. Increased hand strength will help you out in areas like the gym, where you can then hold on to weights for longer periods of time. In other areas such as tennis, you will find that you will be able to significantly swing the racquet with more power. Activities like gymnastics and climbing are areas where having increased hand strength will be particularly important, too, as you must support your body weight with only your grip.4. Improved DexterityHand grips will work to build up your fingers independently, thus improving dexterity.

Skipping Jump Rope USI UNIVERSAL Weighted,https://sportscenter.com.np/product/skipping-jump-rope-usi-weighted/,1820.0,,,220268,USI Universal,Jump Ropes,"Exercise & Fitness, Fitness Accessories, Jump Ropes","Jumping rope is one of the most underrated types of exercise — and it may even be more effective than other forms of cardio.American Association for Health, Physical Education,and Recreation found that college men who spent 10 minutes of jumping rope daily for six weeks improved their cardiovascular fitness just as much as college men who spent 30 minutes of jogging for the same time period.Plus, jumping rope burns lots of calories, strengthens coordination and bone density, and can reduce your risk of injuries and heart disease. Here are 5 science-backed benefits of jumping rope:1. Burns caloriesJumping rope can burn 200 to 300 calories in 15 minutes. That may be more than other continuous cardio exercises, like running or bike riding.It burns more calories than any steady-state cardio — from rowing or jogging to cycling and swimming.Since most of your major muscle groups are working when you jump rope, the exercise is considered thermogenic — it creates a lot of heat in the body. Your body needs to burn more fuel to produce this energy, so it burns lots of calories.You will notice quickly that if you jump rope for two minutes straight as a beginner, it will heavily challenge your cardiovascular capabilities. Your heart rate will rise immediately and have to maintain the amount of energy produced for the muscles. This increases caloric burn as well as challenges the body’s different energy systems.2. Improves coordinationJumping rope requires top-notch coordination, especially as you advance to more skilled moves, such as quickly swinging the rope twice within each jump.“Jump rope improves coordination by requiring several body parts to communicate in order to complete one movement, he feet must jump in time with the wrists rotating in order to create a continuous jumping motion.”Jumping rope helped improve motor coordination among autistic children, who often struggle with balance and coordination.3. Reduces injury riskWith your improved coordination from jumping rope, you’ll be less likely to get hurt either during exercise or in day-to-day activities.Jumping rope forces you to coordinate your upper and lower body movements so you are more agile and your body awareness is improved tremendously, his makes you less injury-prone.4. Improves heart healthSince jumping rope gets your heart pumping, it’s great for your cardiovascular system and heart health. For example, jump roping can increase your V02 Max, the measure of the maximum amount of oxygen a person can utilize during exercise. The higher someone’s VO2 max, the more cardiovascular endurance they have.5. Strengthens bone densityJumping rope can make your bones stronger. Bone density measures the strength of your bones — if you have more minerals, like calcium, in your bones, they are less fragile and less likely to break. A higher bone density can also reduce risk for osteoporosis later in life, particularly for girls and women.“Jumping rope builds bone density through impact training,”When we train with the ct we are stressing the bone more aggressively than most forms of training. The body responds to this stress by remodeling the bone to become stronger and denser.",,"9Ft Length Color: Black, 10 m, 30 m, 15 m, 02 M, 2 m, s",Weighted handles make the workout more rigorous and effective | Adjustable cables | Durable Plastic Cable | Removable weights | Robust built quality | Adjustable size | 9Ft Length | Color: Black,,Weight Vest/ Jacket USI UNIVERSAL (https://sportscenter.com.np/product/weight-jacket-usi-5kg/) | Gymnastics Rings Vixen Roman Rings (https://sportscenter.com.np/product/gymnastics-rings-vixen-roman-rings/) | Weight Lifting Elbow Wrap USI UNIVERSAL Red Line (https://sportscenter.com.np/product/weight-lifting-elbow-wrap-usi-red-line/) | Weight Lifting Straps USI UNIVERSAL With Wrist Support (https://sportscenter.com.np/product/weight-lifting-straps-usi-with-wrist-support/),,1 Piece Skipping Rope,0,,,,,,"{""Weight"": ""1 kg"", ""Dimensions"": ""25 \u00d7 25 \u00d7 15 cm""}","https://sportscenter.com.np/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_5225-1-600x600.jpg, https://sportscenter.com.np/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_5228-1-600x600.jpg, https://sportscenter.com.np/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/skipping-rope-usi-1-600x600.jpg, https://sportscenter.com.np/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/weight-jacket-1-300x300.jpg, https://sportscenter.com.np/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/roman-ring-Vixen-4-1-300x300.jpg, https://sportscenter.com.np/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/elbow-wrap-usii-1-300x300.jpg, https://sportscenter.com.np/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/wirst-strap-usi-3-1-300x300.jpg",4 in stock,4,True

Vixen brand has quality, is reasonably priced and is a leader in innovative products that surpasses the expectation of the users.The Ab Strap was initially a workout tool used in Military exercises for developing a solid core for the staff. It later has evolved as a tool for exercise. It is considered one of the most effective and efficient tools for getting a defined core.One of the easiest ways to strengthen the stomach muscles and build a tighter midsection is through the use of hanging ab straps. The reason ab straps are so effective is that they provide more core resistance since you’re working against gravity and pulling yourself up.Another major benefit is that it puts very low stress on your back because you are hanging.Sports Center recommends the Ab Strapworkout tool for enthusiasts who wish to get a strong core and a defined look.

Vixen is a very well perceived brand by Bhalla Sports PVT Ltd in Nepal. It’s a 50+ years company and is continuing the business. Vixen Sports sells all sorts of sporting goods from Football, indoor games to physical fitness items. It’s one company that has a wide variety of goods under its belt. Vixen brand has quality, is reasonably priced and is a leader in innovative products that surpasses the expectation of the users.Balance board are simple and fun workout tools. You step on it and try to balance your body to a point and try different workouts. This activates muscles, joints and ligaments.  It ends us working the muscle groups that are usually not worked during you’re conventional workouts.Balance boardcan be extremely beneficial to improving your everyday health and well-being. Did you know maintaining and challenging your balance is something that requires your entire body’s effort (including your mind) and therefore works many muscles and joints that don’t normally get as much attention. Wobble Board really does lend itself to help us do all this!Here are Top Five Benefits of using Wobble Boards…1. Improve Flexibility and Joint Strength:Not only does using a Wobble Board work lesser-used muscles, but it also greatly improves flexibility and joint strength: ankles, knees, hips, shoulders etc. This is because the Wobble Board simulates various types of instability that you don’t typically encounter on a day to day basis.2. Challenge Existing Pilates Exercises:The great thing about a Wobble Board is that it’s extremely versatile. There’s an unlimited number of Pilates moves that can be incorporated. Standing movements, sitting movements, movements on the hands, knees etc are all possible. Keeping things fresh and challenging for you each time!3. Engages Your Whole Body:Maintaining your balance and body control requires the whole body working in unison, including the mind. This means every single muscle, joint, tendon, and even the brain is being challenged and strengthened. After a standard workout with a Wobble Board, many people express they feel the burn in muscles they didn’t even know they had! (it activates your smaller stabiliser muscles which help your body burn up to 100 calories an hour)!4. It’s FunWe hear it all of the time, you hop on a board and 5 minutes…10 minutes… 20 minutes later you are having so much fun you don’t even realise you are getting a quality workout. For beginners especially, you can feel it even if you have just been simply standing on the board for a few minutes.5. It Supercharges Your Core Strength:In Pilates, a strong core is the foundation of the practice. It is well known, but sometimes unexpected, that training with a Wobble Board directly engages the core (in addition to the rest of the body). This translates to not only toning your core but improving core strength for all of your Pilates movements that take place on the floor or on other equipment.",,"5 m, 10 m, 20 m, 40cm, 8cm, 150kg, s, large, effort (including your mind), core (in addition to the rest of the body)","Balance board can help improve core strength, coordination, posture, and balance | Suitable for a wide range of exercises, including push-ups, plank, standing balance poses, and targeted workouts for strengthening specific muscles, ligaments, tendons, and joints | Anti-Slip Surface Premium high-quality durable plastic with textured, non-slip surface provides a secure grip for absolute safety. | 40cm diameter large enough for both feet of most sizes. | Height approx. 8cm | Load capacity up to 150kg | Great for Balance Training Perfectly support 360-degree rotation, let your whole body move because of it!

Independently swinging from a long strap, the rings will move at the slightest touch. This instability forces you to concentrate every second that you are on the rings in order to keep from swaying. It can be difficult enough to pull and press your weight on a fixed bar, let alone on two rings that wiggle around! This difficulty translates into building more strength and muscle in your upper body and core.Transitioning your body around the rings from a variety of positions requires a significant amount of upper body strength and control. Yes, you can gain a lot of strength withbodyweight exercisesand of course from lifting weights, but the instability of the rings, along with the combination of movements, can be an entirely different demonstration of strength.Skill work on gymnastic rings integrates strength and coordination training in a way that’s much harder to achieve with other equipment, and it gives you a lot of bang for your buck with regards to training time. It’s very common to hear of strong and fit people that exercise with weights and machines all the time, but are humbled and amazed by how difficult it is to perform even the most basic rings exercises. It is intense training that only requires a few movements to equal the impact of a dozen other regular exercises available in the gym.Also, in terms of space requirements and portability, nothing compares to the great workout you’ll get from this easy-to-carry and simple piece of equipment.",,"4 M, s","Roman Rings with non-slip High-Grade Plastic | Robust and Durable | Lasts Long | Core Strength | Color: Black | Full upper body workouts | Used widely in Crossfit | Defined Back | Length of strap 4 Meters | Muscle ups, pull ups, body rows, Dips, Ab roll outs",,Wrist Straps USI UNIVERSAL 3 Line (https://sportscenter.com.np/product/wrist-straps-usi-3-line/) | Medicine Ball USI UNIVERSAL Leather (https://sportscenter.com.np/product/medicine-ball-usi-leather/) | Weight Vest/ Jacket USI UNIVERSAL (https://sportscenter.com.np/product/weight-jacket-usi-5kg/) | Gym Grip Pads USI UNIVERSAL Leather With Wrist Support (https://sportscenter.com.np/product/gym-grip-pads-usi-leather-with-wrist-support/),,1 pair (2 pieces Roman Rings with straps),0,,,,,,"{""Weight"": ""1 kg"", ""Dimensions"": ""25 \u00d7 25 \u00d7 10 cm""}","https://sportscenter.com.np/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/roman-ring-Vixen-4-1-600x600.jpg, https://sportscenter.com.np/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/roman-rings-800-600x600.jpg, https://sportscenter.com.np/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/roman-rings-vixen-3-600x600.jpg, https://sportscenter.com.np/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/roman-rings-vixen-1-1-600x600.jpg, https://sportscenter.com.np/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/roman-rings-vixen-2-1-600x600.jpg, https://sportscenter.com.np/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/roman-ring800-600x600.jpg, https://sportscenter.com.np/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/wirst-strap-usi-2-1-300x300.jpg, https://sportscenter.com.np/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/medicine-ball-1-1-300x300.jpg, https://sportscenter.com.np/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/weight-jacket-1-300x300.jpg, https://sportscenter.com.np/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/weight-lifting-grip-pads-with-wrist-support-usi-1-300x300.jpg",11 in stock,11,True

Red Sun brand is a very well perceived brand in the country, especially with its weight plates, barbells, dumbbells, carrom boards to name a few. For its quality products Red Sun brand has been able to create good brand equity in the market. With its new introductions and innovative products being introduced in the market at reasonable rates Red Sun brand is here to stay in Nepal and fulfil at the needs of its growing customers.The barbell is the longer version of thedumbbellthat is used for free weight training and competitive sports, such as powerlifting, Olympic weight lifting, andCrossFit. Many exercises can be done using the barbell, such asbicep curl,bench press, Olympic weightlifting,overhead press,deadlift, andsquat. Standard barbells are usually an estimated weight of 20 kilograms (44 lb). Many fitness categories use the barbell for different reasons, for example, powerlifters use the barbell to perform compound exercise movements.Barbell rods allow a wide array of weight training. Weights can be stacked on and reduced as per your need. It’s essential for your workout at home or at a gym. Sports Center recommends it for all your workouts in-home or at the gym.Barbells save timeWhen doing the “Big 4” barbell exercises (squat, bench press, overhead press, and deadlift), you use multiple muscle groups at once.For example, the deadlift uses the back, quadriceps, hamstrings, hips, shoulder and arms muscles in order for you to lift the bar off the ground.Instead of using machines to target each of these muscles, you can work your entire body with one move.If you start your workout with a barbell exercise that uses multiple joints, you’ll only need to add three to five more accessory exercises to have a complete workout.Barbells improve athletic performance.When a beginning trainee uses a barbell for the first time, the body’s response is mainly mental. Learning how to move a barbell teaches our mind how to use all of our muscles together to move an object efficiently.This is because the human body functions as a complete system and our nervous system control the muscles.Improving our neuromuscular connection is what’s initially responsible for any strength gains made in the gym, not getting bigger. In sports, the stronger athlete usually wins.By getting stronger, athletes improve their ability to throw, kick, punch, swing, rotate their core, jump, and run faster.The “Big 4” barbell moves require balance and coordination, unlike machines, resulting in better performance during fitness competitions.Barbells are cheap.If you’re looking to set up a home gym, or you already have one without a barbell, adding a bar and some weights is cheaper than one of those do-it-all cable machines.Barbells are for cardio, too.Walk into your favourite pump,HIIT, or strength training group fitness class and they’ll likely have a type of barbell that we’ll call the cardio barbell.This super-light bar weighs about five pounds, has a small diameter, is shorter than Olympic bars, and be loaded withlight weights.In a group fitness setting, cardio bars are ideal for improving muscular endurance, meaning the ability to perform the same muscle action repeatedly.For example, instead of doing five sets of five reps of shoulder presses with a heavier barbell, you’ll probably do a total of 80 overhead presses in a 60-minute group fitness class with a light barbell.",,"3 FT, 4 FT, 5 FT, 6 FT, 7 FT","Using barbells have countless benefits during your workout | Iron Made | Chrome Finish | machined Knurls for proper grip and feel | Available in Sizes of 3,4,5,6,7 FT | Available with or without the screw sleeves | Available in 23mm and in 28mm thickness | For Non-screw sleeves model, spare collars/ clamps are not included. | 3 FT | 4 FT | 5 FT | 6 FT | 7 FT | With Screw Sleeves (Thread) | Without Screw Sleeves (No Thread) | 3 FT, 4 FT, 5 FT, 6 FT, 7 FT | With Screw Sleeves (Thread), Without Screw Sleeves (No Thread)",,Dips Belt USI UNIVERSAL Leather (https://sportscenter.com.np/product/dips-belt-usi-leather/) | Gym Grip Pads USI UNIVERSAL Leather With Wrist Support (https://sportscenter.com.np/product/gym-grip-pads-usi-leather-with-wrist-support/) | Weight Lifting Elbow Wrap USI UNIVERSAL Red Line (https://sportscenter.com.np/product/weight-lifting-elbow-wrap-usi-red-line/) | Weightlifting Grips USI UNIVERSAL 735 (https://sportscenter.com.np/product/weightlifting-grips-usi-735/),Barbell Bar Size: 3 FT | Barbell Bar Size: 4 FT | Barbell Bar Size: 5 FT | Barbell Bar Size: 6 FT | Barbell Bar Size: 7 FT | Barbell Type: With Screw Sleeves (Thread) | Barbell Type: Without Screw Sleeves (No Thread),1 piece Barbell Rod.,0,Iron Made,,,,,"{""Barbell Bar Size"": ""3 FT, 4 FT, 5 FT, 6 FT, 7 FT"", ""Barbell Type"": ""With Screw Sleeves (Thread), Without Screw Sleeves (No Thread)""}","https://sportscenter.com.np/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/barbel-rod-show-1-600x600.jpg, https://sportscenter.com.np/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/dips-belt-usi-1-300x300.jpg, https://sportscenter.com.np/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/weight-lifting-grip-pads-with-wrist-support-usi-1-300x300.jpg, https://sportscenter.com.np/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/elbow-wrap-usii-1-300x300.jpg, https://sportscenter.com.np/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/foam-roller-2-1-300x300.jpg",Available,,True

Weight Vest/ Jacket USI UNIVERSAL,https://sportscenter.com.np/product/weight-jacket-usi-5kg/,4281.0-6064.0,,,N/A,USI Universal,Body Weight,"Exercise & Fitness, Weights, Body Weight","Weighted vests can help in developing strength, endurance, and cardio by increasing your body weight. Adding mass can influence the ways your muscles stress and strain during workouts. Additionally, wearing weighted vests and body weights can add variety to your workouts.Changing up your fitness routine can be a good habit to get into. By modifying your workout, you’ll place different strains on your body which can help improve your strength and conditioning. For these reasons, weighted vests and body weights can be great additions to help you achieve your fitness goals.Weighted vests and body weights are simply that: wearable weights are worn during exercises for increased resistance and cardio conditioning. The weight levels can vary by product. Most weighted vests can also accommodate extra bars or plates for added weight. The more weight you use, the more resistance you’ll encounter.These tools are useful for bodyweight exercises, plyometrics, and cardiovascular training. Some athletes even use weighted vests in sport-specific training for activities like basketball and tennis. Before strapping on the extra pounds, however, it’s important to understand the benefits.BENEFITSThere are multiple benefits to adding weighted vests or body weights to your fitness routine. For one, weighted vests can help in developing strength, endurance, and cardio by increasing your body weight.Adding mass can influence the ways your muscles stress and strain during workouts. By adding it, more force is exerted which, in turn, leads to faster energy depletion. Both experiences can also affect your breathing pattern and how much oxygen you take in as you train.Stressed muscles, increased breathing and depleted energy may sound negative for progress. But they are, actually, quite the opposite. As your body learns and adjusts to these factors, your strength, endurance, and cardio can see positive results.Additionally, wearing weighted vests and body weights can add variety to your workouts. With weighted vests, you can mix up the stresses placed on your muscles throughout your session. Plus, the added body weight can be useful in multiple exercise sectors. From plyometric movements to bodyweight exercises to even simply walking, using weighted vests can spice up most training programs.",,"10 Kg, 5 Kg","Strong PU/ Neoprene construction | Foam padded shoulder and chest | Nylon tape straps for securing | Available in 5Kg and 10Kg weight Variant | Weight: 5Kg, Size: S/M | Weight: 10Kg, SIze: L/XL | Colour: Black | 10 Kg | 5 Kg | 10 Kg, 5 Kg",,Gym/ Sports Chalk USI UNIVERSAL Magnesium Carbonate (https://sportscenter.com.np/product/gym-sports-chalk-usi-magnesium-carbonate/) | Weight Lifting Elbow Wrap USI UNIVERSAL Red Line (https://sportscenter.com.np/product/weight-lifting-elbow-wrap-usi-red-line/) | Massage Roller USI UNIVERSAL MRB (https://sportscenter.com.np/product/massage-roller-usi-mrb/) | Weight Lifting Straps USI UNIVERSAL 733Ls With Rubber Grips (https://sportscenter.com.np/product/weight-lifting-straps-usi-733ls-with-rubber-grips/),Weight: 10 Kg | Weight: 5 Kg,1 piece Weight Jacket,0,,,,,,"{""Weight"": ""10 Kg, 5 Kg""}","https://sportscenter.com.np/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/weight-jacket-1-600x600.jpg, https://sportscenter.com.np/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Gym_Chalk_Block_-_Magnesium_Carbonate_2000x-1-300x300.jpg, https://sportscenter.com.np/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/elbow-wrap-usii-1-300x300.jpg, https://sportscenter.com.np/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/foam-roller-1-300x300.jpg, https://sportscenter.com.np/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/lifting-straps-usi-1-300x300.jpg",Available,,True
